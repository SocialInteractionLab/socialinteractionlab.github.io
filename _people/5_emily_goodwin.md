I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Stanford linguistics department, advised by [Robert Hawkins](https://rdhawkins.com/), [Cory Shain](https://climblab.org/members/cory_shain), and [Beth Levin](https://web.stanford.edu/~bclevin/). I am broadly interested in meaning, with a focus on verbs, event semantics, and syntactic alternations.
