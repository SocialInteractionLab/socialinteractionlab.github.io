From New Haven, CT, Tilly Brooks is a PhD student in the Stanford Department of Linguistics and JD candidate at Yale Law School.  She is interested in deontic modality, performative utterances, and the interface of law and linguistics.  Focusing both on the effects of law and policy decisions on marginalized linguistic communities and the application of linguistic theories, research methods, and tools to interpretive legal processes, Tilly researches what she calls “the law of language and the language of law.” In the long term, she aims to draw communities of legal scholars, linguists, and legal practitioners together with the common goals of advancing linguistic justice in the practice of law, refining the use of linguistic evidence and tools for law and policy purposes, and using the study of legal language to advance linguistic theory.
