Selena is a first-year PhD student in Stanford’s Computer Science department. She is interested in how humans (and machines) understand and communicate with one another in goal-oriented settings. To study this, she combines tools from artificial intelligence and cognitive (neuro)science. Before Stanford, she graduated from Haverford College studying Math and Cognitive Science, then spent two years as a research assistant with Ev Fedorenko at MIT.
