Ke is a PhD student (2024 admit) in Stanford's Psychology Department. He is interested in applying computational approaches to understand how distributed individual minds support emergent collective-level behaviors and patterns such as cooperation, social norms, and polarization. Prior to Stanford, he completed his master's at New York University and his undergraduate degree at Lanzhou University, China. Outside of research, Kay enjoys pour-over coffee, visiting museums, and drawing.
