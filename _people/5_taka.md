Taka is a first-year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Stanford. His research goal is to understand the step-by-step computations that support language comprehension and production. To this end, he aims to develop computational models that are aligned to humans at both behavioral and algorithmic levels, using insights from cognitive science, linguistics, and neuroscience. Before coming to Stanford, he completed a medical degree from the University of Tokyo in 2025.
