Clementine works in the [Visual Reasoning Lab](https://schlosslab.discovery.wisc.edu/), where she is interested in how people interpret data visualizations, with the goal of understanding how to make visualizations more accessible to broader audiences. Ultimately, this work can be used to make visualization tools, increasing public scientific literacy. Before graduate school, she completed her BS in Psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
