As a recent graduate from UW-Madison (2024) with a background in physics, economics, and psychology, I'm really interested in how we think about other minds and pretty much everything that goes into this sort of reasoning. More recently, I've been interested in how we can model these sorts of things across development. Outside of the lab, I love being outdoors, reading, and spending time with friends.
