Wasita earned a BS in Cognitive Neuroscience from Brown University. Currently a Ph.D. student at Dartmouth with Luke Chang, she collaborates with Robert Hawkins and Jonathan Phillips. Her research focuses on how people collaboratively make sense of others and their shared experiences. She employs real-time multi-user web experiments, natural language processing, and computational modeling. Outside of research, Wasita enjoys playing video games (currently: Baldur's Gate 3) and practicing aerial hoop/pole.
