I am a 6th year PhD candidate in the linguistics department at Stanford. My research focuses on the ways in which cognitive and social processes interact in language processing and production, with a special emphasis on gender and political ideology. When not dissertating, I can be found collaborating with friends on topics such as morphosyntactic variation, sociophonetic variation, and improving experimental methods. Outside of work, I enjoy reading (horror, especially), playing video games (tragically bad Zenyatta/Lifeweaver main), or hanging out with my dog (Dionysus).
