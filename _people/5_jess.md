Jess is interested in the way humans learn to communicate and interact with one another. They approach these questions using computational models, developmental experiments, and publicly available datasets. They are also affiliated with the [Infant Learning Lab](https://infantlearning.waisman.wisc.edu/). They graduated from UC Berkeley in 2020 with a B.A. in Cognitive Science and were the the Lab Manager for the Language and Cognition Lab at Stanford University prior to starting graduate school.
