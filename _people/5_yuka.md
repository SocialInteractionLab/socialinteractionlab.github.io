I am interested in how social factors shape communication. Using behavioral experiments and computational modeling, I am especially interested in understanding how cultural differences in values, common sense and ways of life, lead to differences in everyday interactions. Prior to starting grad school at Stanford in 2025, I completed my undergrad and masterâ€™s degrees at MIT. Outside of research I enjoy swimming, travelling, and doing math.
