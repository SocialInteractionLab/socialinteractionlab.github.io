Ben is a sophomore at UW-Madison studying neurobiology and psychology. He is interested in the emergence of social networks and how their features can inform our perspective on other information networks, from the brain to fungi. He plans to pursue a M.D., Ph.D., or a program mixing the two. In his free time, Ben enjoys running, listening to audiobooks, and taking photographs of wildlife.
