      <h2>Research Focus</h2>
      <p>We are interested in the cognitive mechanisms that allow people to flexibly communicate, collaborate, and coordinate with one another in social interactions. We take an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on computational models of human cognition, large-scale web experiments, and neuroimaging studies.</p>

      <h2>Undergraduate Research Assistants</h2>
      <p> We are always looking for motivated undergraduates to join the lab.
<ul>
  <li>3.5 GPA or higher preferred</li>
  <li>Coursework in Linguistics, Cognitive Science, Psychology, and/or Computer Science</li>
</ul>

      <p>Send a Resume/CV, unofficial transcript, and a brief letter of interest to Prof. Robert Hawkins (<a href="mailto:rdhawkins@stanford.edu">rdhawkins@stanford.edu</a>) and Misha O'Keeffe (<a href="mokeeffe@stanford.edu">mokeeffe@stanford.edu</a>). Please articulate in this email which research questions you are most excited about and some specific reasons why you believe the Social Interaction Lab would be an environment where you believe you could thrive, as well as how you believe you could contribute to our community. </p>

<!--<h2>Currently Recruiting</h2>
     <p>We are currently recruiting a dedicated undergraduate research assistant for <a href="https://socialinteractionlab.github.io/joining/recruitment">a summer position on the neural representation of shared concepts.</a></p>-->
